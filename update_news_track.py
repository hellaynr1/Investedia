"""Price recorder for "since the news".

Every time the price robot runs, this appends one price point for each asset that a recent story names (story impacts, last 72 hours)
to assets/globe/news-track.json. The site draws the since-the-news chart from it: price when the article appeared, and every run after.
Prices come from files the price robot has just written (markets.json, news-prices.json), so no extra network calls are made.
A point is added only when those files carry a new "asof" time, so a failed price run never adds a fake flat line. Failures keep the previous file.
Format: {"schema":1,"updated":"...","asof":"...","s":{"BZ=F":[[epoch_minute, price], ...]}}

Track record (schema 2): every implication stamped at creation (created_at, version, confidence, horizon, scorable) is copied into
assets/globe/news-ledger.json as a frozen "pending" call the first time a run sees it; later runs judge that frozen copy, never the current
story, so a call cannot be changed after the outcome. Back-filled implications are not scorable. Schema-1 calls are kept and marked legacy.
The call is the direction the article implied (up or down; mixed and unclear are not calls).
Outcome rule (outcome-v2, from 2026-10-31):
- start = the later of created_at and the first time the call is provably public (git history / the news file it was first seen in);
  nothing is ever scored from an earlier time than we can prove.
- baseline = the prevailing traded price at start (last exchange bar at or before start, at most 4 days old; none = unresolved), from the asset's own
  exchange session bars (Yahoo 5-minute chart), so each market's real hours, weekends and holidays apply.
- end = the first traded price at least 24 hours after start, at most 4 calendar days after start; none by then = "unresolved".
"hit" = the asset moved the implied way by at least 0.3%, "miss" = it moved the other way by at least 0.3%, "flat" = it moved less
than 0.3% either way (not counted in the hit rate). The ledger, not the live news file, decides which symbols are still tracked:
every pending call is recorded and judged until it is hit, miss, flat or unresolved, even after its article has left the feed.
The price path around each judged call (exchange bars, never interpolated) is kept permanently in call-paths.json.
Format: {"schema":1,"since":"...","horizon_h":24,"calls":[{"id","h","sym","name","dir","pub":epoch_min,"move":pct,"res":"hit|miss|flat"}]}
